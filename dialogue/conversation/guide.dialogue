Riven: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], nice to meet you.
Riven: Welcome to your new farm. I’ve been looking after the place until you arrived.
Riven: As you can see, the cows and chickens are getting hungry.
Riven: Before you can start feeding them, you’ll need to grow some crops.
Riven: Don’t worry, it’s easy once you learn the basics.
Riven: These seeds should help you get started. They grow quickly and make great feed.
Riven: Find a patch of soil you like, clear the weeds, and plant them there.
Riven: After that, just water them each day and they’ll start sprouting soon.
- Take crop seeds
	Arlo: Yeah, I can grow crops. I’ll give it a try.
	Arlo: Thanks, Riven. I’ll look for a good spot to start planting.
	Riven: Good choice. With a little patience, your farm will be full of life.
